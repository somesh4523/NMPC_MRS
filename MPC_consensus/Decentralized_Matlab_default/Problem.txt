Problems:
The not so good tracking at centroid_velocity = 0.1; 
The bot going ulta.
The weights selected highly impact the performancd !!

Possible solutions:
Find a MPC algorithm that can better select when to adjust the angle and when to track the positions.
Can we design a weight scheduling algorithm to adaptively change the weights according the desired trajectory.
